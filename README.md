# COSC 410 Project
# Word-Off
This repository will allow you to build your first professional Java
project, including unit and acceptance tests, using Gradle as the
build tool.

## Building the Project
After you have cloned the repository, you should be able to navigate
to the directory containing the `gradle.build` file. There, you can
build the project by running the command

`gradlew build`

Then, you can run the unit test coverage report.

`gradlew jacocoTestReport`

Then, you can run the acceptance tests. 

`gradlew runrobot`

You can even do multiple things in one statement:

`gradlew build jacocoTestReport runrobot`

When you want to get rid of all of the temporary files (like compiled class files and such), you can say

`gradlew clean`

If you want to do a full build and reporting from a clean project, you can just string it all together:

`gradlew clean build jacocoTestReport runrobot`

If you want to create the generated documentation (based on your Javadoc comments), you can say

`gradlew javadoc`

And if you want to run the application you have created, you can say

`gradlew run`



## Structure
The directory structure that is assumed by Gradle (though it can be changed if you want) is as follows:

    project root  (root directory of project or subproject)
               |
                - build.gradle  (contains the instructions for the build tasks)
               |
                - src  (root directory of the source code; acceptance, main, test)
                    |
                     - acceptance  (root directory of Robot Framework acceptance tests)
                    |
                     - main  (root directory of normal source code)
                    |     |
                    |      - java  (all packages go here)
                    |           |
                    |            - edu    
                    |           |    |
                    |           |     - wofford  (source code goes here)
                    |           | 
                    |            - keywords  (sorce code for Robot Framework custom keywords goes here)
                    |
                     - test  (root directory of unit test code)
                          |
                           - java  (all packages go here)
                                |
                                 - edu    
                                     |
                                      - wofford  (unit test code goes here)

After you run `gradlew build`, a new `build` directory will automatically be created. 
This will contain all of the generated files (compiled class files, JAR files, reports, 
etc.). The most important things here are as follows:

`build/reports/tests/index.html`
: This file holds the results of all of the unit tests.

`build/libs/<name>.jar`
: This file (where *name* is specified in the jar settings of `gradle.build`, 
  is the fully bundled code for the project. You can run this by saying
  `java -jar build/libs/<name>.jar`
  from the project root.

After you run `gradlew runrobot`, a `reports/robot` directory will be 
created in the `build` directory. This will contain the reports for the 
acceptance tests.

`build/reports/robot/report.html`
: This file holds the Robot Framework acceptance test results.

After you run `gradlew jacocoTestReport`, a `reports/jacoco/test/html` directory 
will be created in the `build` directory. This will contain the reports for the 
Jacoco code coverage.
  
`build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`
: This file holds the unit test code coverage results from JaCoCo.

After you run `gradlew javadoc`, a `docs` directory will be created in the project 
root. This will contain all of the generated Javadoc documentation for your 
source files.  

`docs/javadoc/index.html`
: This file is the index to the generated documentation.
